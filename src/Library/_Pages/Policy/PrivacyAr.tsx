							<strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe

							situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can

						<p>
							In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process
							your information without your consent, including, for example:

						<h3>7. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a
							social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party

							this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media
							provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media
							provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and
							profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a
							social media platform.
						</p>
						<p>
							We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in

							Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your
							personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you

							personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and

						<h3>8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to
							fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.
						</p>
						<p>
							We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
							purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required

							in this notice will require us to keep your personal information for longer than the
							period of time in which users have an account with us.
						</p>
						<p>
							When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
							we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for

							measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
							However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
							transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
							be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
							other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
							improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our
							best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
							from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
							secure environment.

							personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will
							deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from

						<h3>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>

						<h3>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
						<p>
							Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and applications include a{" "}
							<strong>Do-Not-Track (DNT)</strong> feature or setting you can activate to signal your
							privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
							and collected.
						</p>
						<p>
							At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
							signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
							signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
							tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted in the future, we will
							inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
						</p>
						<p>
							California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals.
							Because there is currently no industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring
							DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
